My Answers to learnyounode

This was insanely fun and challenging. I thank the folks that created it.

I followed [Mikeal Rogers (mikeal)](https://github.com/mikeal) advice on [Future Aloof](http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html) and added the node_modules directories.

Hope this helps.
